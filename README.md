# AnalisisP2P
In the project is proposed a database analysis. The database is for transactions and it is implemented on Spark. It used the following algoritms:
- Randon forest in order to classify and check the importance of the variables
- Evaluate the random forest with their performance form probabilistic pint of view
- Sub-sampling of the majority class (legal transactions) via K-means
- Improve the performance of random forest using balanced datasets
- possible implementation of instance selection
